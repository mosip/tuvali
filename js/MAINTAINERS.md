# Maintainers

## About This File

You can find out who's contributed recently just by looking at GitHub's
[contributors list](../../graphs/contributors). But there are a few more
things you ought to know about who maintains this code, and how they do it:

1. Make sure you read our [contributor guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
   so you understand how we work and how to collaborate effectively.
   This includes instructions about pull request and code review protocols,
   and it explains what we mean by calling someone a "maintainer" in this
   file.
2. Be aware that individual folders in the project may have more
   specific maintainers; if you see another `MAINTAINERS.md` in a subfolder,
   that governs the tree below it.
3. A lot of interactions with maintainers take place on [Discourse](https://community.mosip.io).
   You'll need a Github or Google account to comment there;
   creating them is self-service.
4. Issues and features are tracked [here](https://mosip.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/INJI/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20%22INJI%22%20and%20labels%20%3D%20%22BLE%22%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC).
   The project name you want, once in Jira, is "Inji".
5. We use developer certificate of origin [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) in all of MOSIP repositories,
   so to get your pull requests accepted, you must certify your commits by signing off on each commit.
   You can use the -s command line option in git to append the signoff automatically to your commit message:
   ``` $ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message' ```

## Who To Contact

For ordinary questions, we suggest you contact [active contributors](../../graphs/contributors)
generically, on discourse. If that doesn't get someone's attention,
feel free to contact the contributors individually.

Maintainers are busy and delegate many decisions to other trusted
contributors. However, it is appropriate to contact them if you have a
complex design decision or a controversial PR.
